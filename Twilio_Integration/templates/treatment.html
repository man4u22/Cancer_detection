            <h2>Understanding Skin Cancer</h2>
            <p>Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, but it is highly treatable if detected early. Treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Available Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>Your treatment options for skin cancer and the precancerous skin lesions known as actinic keratoses will vary, depending on the size, type, depth, and location of the lesions. Small skin cancers limited to the surface of the skin may not require treatment beyond an initial skin biopsy that removes the entire growth.</p>

            <p>If additional treatment is needed, options may include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Freezing:</strong> Your doctor may destroy actinic keratoses and some small, early skin cancers by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery). The dead tissue sloughs off when it thaws.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Excisional surgery:</strong> This type of treatment may be appropriate for any type of skin cancer. Your doctor cuts out (excises) the cancerous tissue and a surrounding margin of healthy skin. A wide excision — removing extra normal skin around the tumor — may be recommended in some cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mohs surgery:</strong> This procedure is for larger, recurring, or difficult-to-treat skin cancers, which may include both basal and squamous cell carcinomas. It's often used in areas where it's necessary to conserve as much skin as possible, such as on the nose.
                    <p>During Mohs surgery, your doctor removes the skin growth layer by layer, examining each layer under the microscope, until no abnormal cells remain. This procedure allows cancerous cells to be removed without taking an excessive amount of surrounding healthy skin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Curettage and electrodesiccation or cryotherapy:</strong> After removing most of a growth, your doctor scrapes away layers of cancer cells using a device with a circular blade (curet). An electric needle destroys any remaining cancer cells. In a variation of this procedure, liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the base and edges of the treated area.
                    <p>These simple, quick procedures may be used to treat basal cell cancers or thin squamous cell cancers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be an option when cancer can't be completely removed during surgery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill cancer cells. For cancers limited to the top layer of skin, creams or lotions containing anti-cancer agents may be applied directly to the skin. Systemic chemotherapy can be used to treat skin cancers that have spread to other parts of the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Photodynamic therapy:</strong> This treatment destroys skin cancer cells with a combination of laser light and drugs that makes cancer cells sensitive to light.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biological therapy:</strong> Biological therapy uses your body's immune system to kill cancer cells.
                </li>
